# Heart-disease-prediction

Problem: To build a classifier model strong enough to predict heart disease, using data of patient records
which includes the values related to the risk factors in developing CVD. 

Dataset: Kaggle dataset related to heart
disease, which was sourced from Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, University Hospital, Zurich,
University Hospital, Basel, and Cleveland Clinic Foundation

The dataset contains 1025 records of observations of patients as rows and 14 variables related to
heart as columns. The columns are age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum
cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electro cardio graphic results, maximum heart rate
achieved, exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of
the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, presence of
thalassemia and the target variable which is the presence of heart disease.

This dataset, after preprocessing and feature selection, is used to train classifiers like Support
Learning Machine, Decision Trees, and one of the ensemble learning approach, which is random
forest classifier and tested for accuracies.
